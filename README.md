## Overview

You were tasked by your senior developer to build a simple community board that allowed people to post new announcements regarding the happenings in the company. Luckily for you, there are already some posts that need to show on that page anyway, so you won't have to start from scratch.

Real talk, though, the purpose of this application is to build and burn it as many times as you need to. In other words, build it to completion, then build it again and again until you can comment through every step of the code and be able to describe it to me in a one-on-one on Monday or Tuesday of next week.

## User stories

- As a user, I can see all of the posts. Each post will contain the following fields: author, content, and title. There is a date field in the object you will be getting, too, but that's not required.
- As a user, I can add a post in a form that sits above the list of posts. The form contains the following fields: author, content, and title.
- As a user, I am NOT able to edit or remove a post.

## Guidelines

- You must use Bootstrap in some capacity, be it through just plain Bootstrap CSS or Reactstrap. Either way is fine.
- Concerns MUST be separated, so be mindful of how you structure your component tree.
- You will use the `collective-api` server to get the posts at [http://localhost:8082/api/posts](http://localhost:8082/api/posts)
